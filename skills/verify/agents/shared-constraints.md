# Shared Constraints (Verification Agents)

- **Sandbox only.** All file creation, modification, and command execution happens inside the sandbox worktree directory. Never touch the main workspace.
- **Never push.** Do not run `git push`, `gh`, `glab`, or any command that communicates with a remote repository.
- **Follow the verification protocol.** Every claim of pass/fail must be backed by fresh evidence: run the command, read the output, state the result with evidence. Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/verification-protocol.md` for the full protocol.
- **Report structured results.** Use the output format specified for each agent.

## Quality Bar

- Every verification must produce a clear PASS or FAIL with evidence
- If a verification cannot be completed (missing dependencies, external services, etc.), report BLOCKED with reason
- Do not guess or assume outcomes — run the verification and observe
- Do not fix source code bugs — only report findings
