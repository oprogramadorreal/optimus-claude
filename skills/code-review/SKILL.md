description: Reviews local changes, an open PR/MR, or a branch diff against project coding guidelines using 5-7 parallel review agents (bug detection, security/logic, guideline compliance x2, code simplification, plus conditional test-coverage and contract-quality agents). High signal only — bugs, logic errors, security issues, guideline violations. Read-only; fixes or PR comments only on explicit approval. For iterative auto-fix, use /optimus:deep review.

# Code Review

Analyze local git changes (or a PR/MR) against the project's coding guidelines with parallel review agents. High-signal findings only — excludes style concerns, subjective suggestions, and linter-catchable issues.

## Step 1: Parse Arguments and Verify Prerequisites

- `--branch` → force the branch diff in Step 3, skipping the PR auto-route. No effect when local changes exist or an explicit PR is requested (`--pr N`, `#N`, or a PR URL).
- Everything else is natural-language scope/focus: paths, PR numbers, refs (e.g., "review src/auth", "review PR #42", "changes since main").

**Multi-repo**: if the current directory has no `.git/` directory, read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/multi-repo-detection.md` and apply it. In a workspace, run Step 3's git commands inside each child repo, PR/MR mode requires the user to name a repo, and Step 4 loads each repo's docs independently; if changed files map to no child repo, ask which repo's context applies.

**Prerequisites**: if `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/docs/coding-guidelines.md` is missing, recommend `/optimus:init` first. On the user's choice to continue, fall back to the bundled baseline: read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/templates/docs/coding-guidelines.md` and review against it plus general best practices for the detected stack — a shared, versioned anchor keeps findings reproducible where ad-hoc judgment would not. Note in the report that findings are generic, not project-specific.

## Step 2: Inline Harness Mode Detection

If your invocation prompt body contains `HARNESS_MODE_INLINE`, you are running inside the `/optimus:deep` orchestrator as a single iteration. Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/references/harness-mode.md` and follow its single-iteration execution protocol — it covers progress-file reading, scope and file-list rules, agent-prompt overrides, and the apply/output protocol. Proceed through Steps 3–7, skip Step 8 (the orchestrator handles approval upfront), apply the fixes mechanically, emit the structured JSON per the harness-mode output protocol, and stop. Do not use `AskUserQuestion`. Do not loop.

If `HARNESS_MODE_INLINE` is NOT present, continue with the standard interactive flow below.

## Step 3: Determine Review Scope

**Local changes (default)**: gather staged + unstaged + untracked via `git diff --cached`, `git diff`, and `git status --short`. If local changes exist, review them.

**No local changes → auto-route** (no user prompt):

1. Detect the platform per the **Platform Detection Algorithm** in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/platform-detection.md`.
2. Check for an open PR/MR on the current branch: GitHub `gh pr view --json number,state,baseRefName` (use only when `state` is `"OPEN"`); GitLab `glab mr view --output json` (use `iid`/`target_branch` only when `state` is `"opened"`; a failed command means no MR — unless it looks like an auth or connectivity error, in which case tell the user before falling back). Platform unknown: try both, use the first confirmed open PR/MR.
3. Base = the PR/MR target branch; with no open PR/MR or no CLI, detect the default branch per `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/default-branch-detection.md`. If detection fails, ask the user for a base ref — never guess; if they have none, report there is nothing to review.
4. Run `git log --oneline origin/<base>..HEAD`; if commits exist, route (branch diffs use Branch/ref mode with `<ref>` = `origin/<base>`; for GitLab say "MR !N" instead of "PR #N"):
   - `--branch` set → branch diff.
   - Open PR/MR found AND HEAD fully pushed (`git rev-list origin/<current-branch>..HEAD` exits 0 with no output) → enter PR mode for that PR without re-prompting. Tell the user, in one line: *"Reviewing PR #N — using the PR description as author intent context. Pass `--branch` to review the branch diff instead."*
   - Open PR/MR found BUT HEAD has unpushed commits or pushed state cannot be determined → branch diff. Tell the user, in one line: *"Reviewing the branch diff — PR #N exists but HEAD is not fully pushed. Pass `--pr N` to review only the PR's pushed state."*
   - No open PR/MR (or CLI unavailable) → branch diff.

**Nothing at all** → inform the user there are no changes to review; suggest staging changes or specifying a PR.

### PR mode

Entered on explicit request or via the auto-route. Detect the platform per the **Platform Detection Algorithm** (including **Signal Conflict Resolution**) in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/platform-detection.md`; if unknown, ask the user.

| | GitHub | GitLab |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata | `gh pr view <N> --json state,isDraft,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid` | `glab mr view <N> --output json` |
| `pr-description` fields | `title` + `body` | `title` + `description` |
| Diff | `gh pr diff <N>` | `glab mr diff <N>` |
| Head SHA field | `headRefOid` | `sha` |
| Checkout | `gh pr checkout <N>` | `glab mr checkout <N>` |

- Verify the CLI first (`gh --version` / `glab --version`); if unavailable → tell the user PR/MR review requires it and offer the branch diff instead.
- Store the metadata's title + body as `pr-description` for Steps 5–6 (author intent context).
- PR/MR closed or merged → warn and stop.
- **Head mismatch**: if the head SHA differs from `git rev-parse HEAD`, offer the checkout command before continuing — Step 5's agents and Step 6's validation read the local working tree, so a mismatched checkout silently reviews the wrong file content. If declined, proceed with a warning that finding validation and line context come from the local tree, not the PR head.

**Branch/ref mode**: `git diff <ref>...HEAD` for the diff; `git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD` for the file list.

**Path filter**: when the user scopes to a path, filter the diff to it (`git diff -- <path>`, `git diff --cached -- <path>`).

### Scope summary

Present a brief `## Review Scope` summary before proceeding: mode (local changes / PR #N / branch diff since `<ref>`), files changed, lines +/-. In PR/MR mode, append one note whenever intent-vs-implementation checks will not run — either the captured `pr-description` body is empty, **or** it is non-empty but has no `## Intent` section (apply the **Detection rule** in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/pr-template.md`, the same rule `/optimus:pr` writes against, so both halves of the handoff share one definition). Say which case applies: intent-vs-implementation checks are skipped; running `/optimus:pr` in the implementation conversation can add intent metadata. Without this note a rich hand-written description reads as fully reviewed while every agent silently skipped the check. This is a soft warning — the review proceeds either way.

**Large diff warning**: if more than 50 files or 3000 lines are changed, warn the user and suggest narrowing the scope (e.g., a specific path or directory).

## Step 4: Load Project Context

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/constraint-doc-loading.md` and load the constraint docs it lists, applying its **Monorepo Scoping Rule** (a subproject's own docs govern that subproject's files) and **Submodule Exclusion** (a `.git` *file* marks a submodule — exclude those directories from the review). In a multi-repo workspace, load each changed repo's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/docs/` independently and apply per-repo context to that repo's files. These docs define the review criteria — every guideline finding must be justified by what they establish; never impose external preferences.

Present a brief context summary (docs loaded, docs missing with fallback status, project type), then proceed immediately to Step 5 — do not wait for confirmation.

## Step 5: Parallel Multi-Agent Review (5–7 agents)

Launch every applicable agent as a `general-purpose` Agent tool call in a **single** message so they run in parallel. The full fan-out is the design — do not reduce the count to save tokens or time.

| Agent | Role | Prompt file |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 — Bug Detector | Null access, off-by-one, races, resource leaks, type mismatches | `bug-detector.md` |
| 2 — Security & Logic | Injection, XSS, secrets, missing auth, security-relevant API violations | `security-reviewer.md` |
| 3 — Guideline Compliance A | Explicit violations of project docs with exact rule citations | `guideline-reviewer.md` |
| 4 — Guideline Compliance B | Same task as Agent 3 — independent review reduces false negatives | `guideline-reviewer.md` |
| 5 — Code Simplifier | Unnecessary complexity, dead code, removal-only simplifications | `code-simplifier.md` |
| 6 — Test Guardian | Test coverage gaps, structural barriers to testability | `test-guardian.md` |
| 7 — Contracts Reviewer | Backward compatibility, type safety, versioning, encapsulation | `contracts-reviewer.md` |

Agents 1–5 always run. Agent 6 runs when test infrastructure is detected (`.claude/docs/testing.md` or a subproject `docs/testing.md` exists). Agent 7 runs when any changed file matches a contract pattern — directory patterns: `api/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `endpoints/`, `handlers/`, `graphql/`, `proto/`, `grpc/`; file patterns: `*.dto.*`, `*.schema.*`, `*.contract.*`, `openapi.*`, `swagger.*`, `*.proto`, `*.graphql`, `*.gql`. No match → skip Agent 7 entirely.

**Prompt assembly**: read the prompt files from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/agents/`, plus `agents/shared-constraints.md` for the shared quality bar and output format. Compose per "Prompt assembly at dispatch time" in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/references/agent-architecture.md` — substitute the resolved absolute plugin root for every `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, and inline or absolutize the bare `shared-constraints.md` references (subagents inherit neither the variable nor the cwd). Also: strip each prompt file's YAML frontmatter, and for Agents 3–4 replace `guideline-reviewer.md`'s "Dynamic Prompt Construction" section with the concrete doc-reading instructions for this project's layout from Step 4 (that section addresses the dispatcher, not the agent).

End every assembled prompt with the changed-file list (from Step 3, or `scope_files.current` in harness mode when pre-populated) followed by the diff hunks — at minimum the changed line ranges per file when the diff is too large to inline. Agents have no sanctioned way to compute the diff themselves; never send file paths alone. Findings are bounded by the Finding Cap in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/references/shared-agent-constraints.md`.

### PR/MR context injection (PR/MR mode only)

If the `pr-description` body captured in Step 3 is non-empty, prepend the PR/MR Context Block from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/references/context-injection-blocks.md` (template, truncation rule, guardrail language) to every agent prompt immediately before the file list. Under `HARNESS_MODE_INLINE` on iterations 2+, also prepend the Iteration Context Block from the same reference — it defines the ordering when both blocks apply. Wait for all launched agents to complete before proceeding to Step 6.

## Step 6: Validate Findings

Treat agent findings as claims requiring independent evidence, not ground truth — verify against the actual code and report what you observed, never what "should" be true. For each finding:

1. **Context check** — read ±30 lines around the flagged location to confirm the issue exists in context
2. **Intent check** — comments, test assertions, or established patterns may explain the code (what looks like a bug may be intentional)
3. **Pre-existing check** — the issue must be introduced by these changes, not pre-existing in unchanged code
4. **Cross-agent consensus** — guideline findings flagged by both Agents 3 and 4 gain confidence
5. **Runtime assumption check** — unvalidated, undocumented assumptions about inputs, dependencies, or environment in changed code strengthen a finding's confidence

**Change-intent awareness**: for each file with findings, run `git log --no-merges --format="%h %s" -5 -- <file>`. If a recent commit shows deliberate introduction of code a finding wants to remove or revert (e.g., "fix null check", "harden auth flow") → reduce that finding's confidence one level (High → Medium, Medium → Low → drop). If the message is uninformative, run `git show <sha> -- <file>` and judge the diff for deliberate defensive code. Skip gracefully when `git log` fails or returns nothing.

### PR/MR description as intent signal

If a `pr-description` was captured, use it as an additional soft signal: an explicit explanation of *why* a flagged change was made, corroborated by git history → one confidence reduction; contradicted or unsupported by git history → trust the history (code over claims); silent about the finding → no adjustment. Never hard-filter a finding on the description alone.

**Confidence**: High (clear evidence) and Medium (plausible, some evidence) proceed to Step 7; Low is dropped.

## Step 7: Consolidate and Present Findings

- **Dedupe**: same file + line range + category → keep the more detailed version. Guideline findings from both Agents 3 and 4 merge into one, noted "confirmed by independent review".
- **Contradictions**: findings on the same code region recommending opposite directions (e.g., "add validation" vs. "simplify this validation") → keep the higher severity; on ties, keep the security/correctness finding — security requirements justify proportionate complexity.
- **Severity**: **Critical** — bugs, security vulnerabilities, runtime failures, Intent Mismatch contradicting a stated non-goal. **Warning** — guideline violations, missing error handling, coverage gaps on critical paths, backward-incompatible contract changes, Intent Mismatch on unsupported scope claims. **Suggestion** — quality improvements, minor drift, Intent Mismatch on partial matches.
- **Finding cap**: max **15 domain findings** in the report, prioritized by severity then confidence. `Intent Mismatch` findings surface on top of the 15 — up to 5, deduplicated across agents, sorted by severity, presented after the domain findings (the per-agent budget is registered in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/references/shared-agent-constraints.md` "Finding Cap"). If more issues exist, note the count and suggest a narrower scope or `/optimus:deep review`.

Open with a **Change Summary** — 2–4 factual sentences on what the changes accomplish — so the user can verify the review understood them.

```

In PR mode, include full-SHA code links:
- GitHub: `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/[full-sha]/path#L[start]-L[end]`
- GitLab: extract the instance URL from `git remote get-url origin`, then `https://[gitlab-host]/owner/repo/-/blob/[full-sha]/path#L[start]-L[end]`

## Step 8: Offer Actions

Verdict **CHANGES LOOK GOOD** → skip this step entirely; go to the closing recommendation.

Verdict **ISSUES FOUND** → `AskUserQuestion` (header "Action", question "How would you like to proceed with the review findings?"):
- **Fix issues** — apply suggested fixes directly, then run tests to verify
- **Post comment** (PR/MR mode only) — post the review summary as a PR/MR comment
- **Skip** — keep the report as reference only

**Posting a comment**: write the review summary to a temp file in the current working directory: `TMPFILE=$(mktemp ./review-summary-XXXXXX.md)`. Always clean up after the posting attempt (whether it succeeds or fails): `rm -f "$TMPFILE"`. Use a relative path, not `/tmp` — on Windows, Git Bash's `/tmp` mount is unresolvable by the native `gh.exe`/`glab.exe`, which would silently submit an empty comment.

- GitHub: `gh pr comment <N> --body-file "$TMPFILE"`
- GitLab: `glab api -X POST "projects/:id/merge_requests/<N>/notes" -F body=@"$TMPFILE"` — avoids the shell metacharacter breakage `glab mr note --message "$(cat ...)"` would hit with code snippets in the summary

## Important

- This skill is read-only by default: never modify files, commit, push, or post comments without explicit user approval. Approved fixes remain local modifications for the user to review with `git diff` before committing.
- When changes are too broad for effective review, recommend narrowing scope.

Close by recommending the next step: issues fixed → `/optimus:commit`; clean or fixes skipped → `/optimus:pr` (skip when already reviewing a PR/MR) — either way, stay in this conversation so the implementation context is captured. For iterative auto-fix, run `/optimus:deep review` in a fresh conversation.
