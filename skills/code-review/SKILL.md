# Code Review

Analyze local git changes, PRs/MRs, or branch diffs against the project's coding guidelines, using up to 6 parallel review agents for comprehensive coverage. High-signal findings only: bugs, logic errors, security issues, guideline violations. Excludes style concerns, subjective suggestions, and linter-catchable issues.

## Step 1: Determine Review Scope

Parse arguments and detect what to review.

### Multi-repo workspace detection

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/multi-repo-detection.md` for workspace detection. If a multi-repo workspace is detected:
- Run the git commands below inside each child repo (the workspace root has no `.git/`, so git commands must target individual repos)
- For PR/MR mode, the user must specify which repo — PRs/MRs belong to individual repos
- If changed files cannot be mapped to any child repo (e.g., files at the workspace root), ask the user which repo's context to apply
- Prerequisite loading in Step 2 will resolve per-repo docs independently

### Local changes (default — no arguments)

Run the following git commands to gather all local changes:

```bash
# Staged changes
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached

# Unstaged changes to tracked files
git diff --stat
git diff

# Untracked files
git status --short
```

- **If local changes found** → review them (staged + unstaged + untracked)
- **If no local changes** → check for commits ahead of the default branch:
  - Run `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` (try `main`, then `master` if no remote)
  - If commits found → offer to review the branch diff
  - Also check for a PR/MR (use the same platform detection as PR mode below):
    - If GitLab: `glab mr view --output json` (ignore errors if `glab` is not installed) — if it fails, check stderr: "no open merge request" or "404" means no MR; auth or network errors → inform the user
    - If GitHub: `gh pr view --json number,state,title` (ignore errors if `gh` is not installed)
    - If platform unknown: try both, ignore all errors
  - If PR/MR found → offer to review it
- **If nothing at all** → inform the user there are no changes to review and suggest staging changes or specifying a PR

### PR mode (explicit request)

When the user says "review PR #42", passes `--pr`, `#123`, or a PR URL:

**Platform detection** — read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/platform-detection.md` and use the **Platform Detection Algorithm** section (including the **Signal Conflict Resolution** rule). If platform is unknown → inform the user and ask them to specify.

**GitHub projects:**
- Verify `gh` is available by running `gh --version`. If not available, inform the user that PR review requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and offer to review the branch diff instead
- Use `gh pr view <N> --json state,isDraft,title,body,baseRefName,headRefName` to get PR metadata
- Use `gh pr diff <N>` to get the actual diff
- If the PR is closed or merged → warn and stop

**GitLab projects:**
- Verify `glab` is available by running `glab --version`. If not available, inform the user: "This project uses GitLab. PR/MR review requires the GitLab CLI (`glab`). You can use branch diff mode instead: `/optimus:code-review changes since origin/main`." Offer to review the branch diff as a fallback.
- Use `glab mr view <N> --output json` to get MR metadata
- Use `glab mr diff <N>` to get the actual diff
- If the MR is closed or merged → warn and stop

### Branch/ref mode

When the user says "review changes since main" or a similar reference:
- Use `git diff <ref>...HEAD` for the diff
- Use `git diff --name-only <ref>...HEAD` for the file list

### Path filter

When the user specifies a path (e.g., "review src/auth"):
- Filter local changes to that path using `git diff -- <path>` and `git diff --cached -- <path>`

### Scope summary

Present a brief summary before proceeding:

```
## Review Scope
- Mode: Local changes / PR #N / Branch diff since <ref>
- Files changed: [N]
- Lines: +[added] / -[removed]
```

### Large diff warning

If more than 50 files or 3000 lines are changed, warn the user and suggest narrowing the scope (e.g., specific path or directory).

## Step 2: Verify Prerequisites and Load Project Context

### Multi-repo workspace prerequisite loading

If a multi-repo workspace was detected in Step 1, resolve prerequisites per-repo:
- Determine which repo(s) the changed files belong to (from the diff file paths gathered in Step 1)
- Load each repo's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/docs/` independently (not the workspace root)
- If changes span multiple repos, apply per-repo context when reviewing that repo's files

### Documentation prerequisites

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/prerequisite-check.md` and apply the prerequisite check (CLAUDE.md + coding-guidelines.md existence, fallback logic).

### Agent prerequisites

Check that these files exist:
- `.claude/agents/code-simplifier.md`
- `.claude/agents/test-guardian.md`

**If either is missing**, warn the user and recommend running `/optimus:init` to install them. Use these fallbacks so the skill can still run:
- `code-simplifier.md` missing → Agent 5 (Code Simplifier) will be skipped in Step 4; the review still covers bugs, security, and guidelines via Agents 1–4
- `test-guardian.md` missing → Agent 6 (Test Guardian) will be skipped in Step 4; test coverage gaps will not be analyzed
- Both missing → both agents skipped; only Agents 1–4 run (still provides bug, security, and guideline coverage); strongly recommend `/optimus:init` for full 6-agent review

### Load constraint docs

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/constraint-doc-loading.md` for the full document loading procedure (single project and monorepo layouts, scoping rules).

These files define the review criteria. Every guideline-related finding must be justified by what these docs establish — never impose external preferences.

### Exclude git submodules

Apply the "Submodule Exclusion" rule from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/constraint-doc-loading.md` — exclude submodule directories from the review.

### Context summary

Before proceeding to the review, present a brief summary:
- Docs loaded (with paths)
- Docs missing (with fallback status)
- Agents available (with skip status for missing ones)
- Project type (single project / monorepo / multi-repo workspace)

Proceed immediately to Step 3 — do not wait for user confirmation.

## Step 3: Deep Mode Activation

If the user invoked with `deep` (e.g., `/optimus:code-review deep` or `/optimus:code-review deep "focus on src/auth"`), activate deep mode. Deep mode loops review-fix cycles (Steps 4–7) until zero new findings remain or **5 iterations** are reached, then presents a single consolidated report with all fixes already applied as local changes.

### PR/MR mode guard

If the review mode is PR/MR (from Step 1), deep mode is not available — it auto-applies fixes locally, which does not apply to someone else's PR. Warn: "Deep mode is not available for PR/MR review — it auto-applies fixes locally. Falling back to normal mode." Then continue with the standard single-pass flow.

### Test command guard

Before proceeding, check whether a test command is available (from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). If no test command exists, deep mode's auto-fix loop has no safety net — fall back to normal mode and warn: "Deep mode requires a test command for safe auto-fix. Falling back to normal mode — run `/optimus:unit-test` first to enable deep mode." Then continue with the standard single-pass flow.

### User confirmation

If a test command is available, warn the user:

> **Deep mode** runs up to 5 iterative review-fix passes. Each iteration is a full multi-agent analysis-fix cycle — credit and time consumption multiplies with iteration count. Low test coverage increases the chance of undetected breakage; consider running `/optimus:unit-test` first to strengthen the safety net. Test command: `<resolved-test-command>`. Fixes will be applied automatically to files in scope without per-change approval. Review all local modifications with `git diff` before committing.

Then use `AskUserQuestion` — header "Deep mode", question "Proceed with deep mode?":
- **Start deep mode** — "Run iterative review-fix until clean (max 5 iterations)"
- **Normal mode** — "Single pass with manual fix option instead"

If the user did not invoke with `deep`, skip this step entirely.

If the user selects **Normal mode**, continue with the standard single-pass flow. Record the user's choice as a `deep-mode` flag for subsequent steps.

## Step 4: Parallel Multi-Agent Review (up to 6 agents)

4 core review agents + 2 project-level agents, all launched in parallel for maximum coverage.

Launch up to 6 `general-purpose` Agent tool calls simultaneously. Agents 1–4 always run; Agents 5–6 only run if the corresponding project agent file exists (checked in Step 2).

Each agent receives the list of changed file paths from Step 1.

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/code-review/references/agent-prompts.md` for the full prompt templates, quality bar, exclusion rules, and false positive guidance for all 6 agents.

### Agent overview

| Agent | Role | Runs when |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 — Bug Detector | Null access, off-by-one, race conditions, resource leaks, type mismatches | Always |
| 2 — Security & Logic | SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, missing auth, API contract violations | Always |
| 3 — Guideline Compliance A | Explicit violations of project docs with exact rule citations | Always |
| 4 — Guideline Compliance B | Same task as Agent 3 — independent review reduces false negatives | Always |
| 5 — Code Simplifier | Unnecessary complexity, naming, dead code, pattern violations | `.claude/agents/code-simplifier.md` exists |
| 6 — Test Guardian | Test coverage gaps, structural barriers to testability | `.claude/agents/test-guardian.md` exists |

Each agent: max 8 findings, structured list format. Guideline agents (3–4) are constructed dynamically based on Step 2's doc loading results (single project vs monorepo paths).

### Execution

Launch all available agents simultaneously (parallel, not sequential). Wait for all launched agents to complete before proceeding to Step 5.

**Agent availability summary**: Agents 1–4 always run (no project dependencies). Agents 5–6 depend on installed project agents. If neither project agent exists, note in the summary and recommend `/optimus:init` for full 6-agent review.

## Step 5: Validate Findings

Independently verify each finding to filter false positives. Apply the verification protocol from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/verification-protocol.md` — treat agent-reported findings as claims that require independent evidence, not as ground truth.

For each finding from Step 4:
1. **Context check** — read ±30 lines around the flagged location to verify the issue exists in context
2. **Intent check** — look for comments, test assertions, or established patterns that explain the code's behavior (what looks like a bug may be intentional)
3. **Pre-existing check** — verify the issue was introduced by the changes, not pre-existing in unchanged code
4. **Cross-agent consensus** — for guideline findings, check if both Agents 3 and 4 flagged the same issue (consensus = higher confidence)

Assign confidence:
- **High** — clear issue with strong evidence → keep
- **Medium** — plausible issue, some evidence → keep with note
- **Low** — uncertain, likely false positive → drop

Only findings with High or Medium confidence proceed to Step 6.

## Step 6: Consolidate and Present Findings

Merge validated findings from Steps 4–5 (agents and validation). Deduplicate: if two agents flagged the same file and line range for the same category, keep the more detailed version. For guideline findings flagged by both Agents 3 and 4, merge into one finding and note "confirmed by independent review".

### Contradiction resolution

After deduplication, check for **cross-agent contradictions** — findings that target the same code region but recommend opposite directions (e.g., "add more validation" vs. "simplify this validation"). Keep the higher-severity finding and drop the other. When severities are equal, keep the security/correctness finding — security requirements justify proportionate complexity.

### Change Summary

Before presenting findings, write a concise summary (2–4 sentences) of what the reviewed changes accomplish. Describe the intent and effect of the changes — what was added, modified, or removed and why. Base this on the diff and the agents' analysis. This lets the user verify the review understood their changes correctly.

### Severity

- **Critical** — Bugs, security vulnerabilities, runtime failures
- **Warning** — Guideline violations, missing error handling, test coverage gaps for critical paths
- **Suggestion** — Code quality improvements, minor guideline drift, test coverage gaps for non-critical paths

### Finding cap

**Normal mode:** Maximum **15 findings** across all sources, prioritized by severity then confidence. If more issues exist, note the count (e.g., "15 of ~22 findings shown") and suggest re-running with `deep` for exhaustive review, or narrowing scope — e.g., `/optimus:code-review` "focus on src/auth".

**Deep mode:** Maximum **15 findings per iteration**, prioritized by severity then confidence. Findings are accumulated across iterations into `accumulated-findings` — do not present them yet (the consolidated report comes after the loop ends). Instead of presenting the output format below, append this iteration's validated findings to `accumulated-findings`. Deduplicate against findings from previous iterations (same file, same line range, same category = duplicate), excluding findings marked "(reverted — test failure)" — if the same issue reappears after a failed fix, keep it and annotate as "(persistent — fix failed)". If more than 15 findings are detected, note the overflow count in the iteration progress so the user understands exhaustive coverage may require additional runs. Then proceed to Step 7.

### Output format

```
## Code Review

### Summary
- Scope: [local changes / PR #N / branch diff since X]
- Files reviewed: [N]
- Lines changed: +[A] / -[R]
- Findings: [N] (Critical: [N], Warning: [N], Suggestion: [N])
- Docs used: [list of docs loaded]
- Agents: bug-detector, security-reviewer, guideline-A, guideline-B[, code-simplifier][, test-guardian]
- Verdict: CHANGES LOOK GOOD / ISSUES FOUND

### Change Summary
[2–4 sentences describing what the changes do — their intent, what was added/modified/removed, and the overall effect. Keep it factual and concise.]

### Findings

**[N]. [Finding title]** (Critical/Warning/Suggestion — [Bug/Security/Guideline/Quality/Test Gap])
- **File:** `file:line`
- **Category:** [Bug | Security | Guideline Violation | Code Quality | Test Coverage Gap]
- **Guideline:** [which project guideline, or "General: bug/security"]
- **Issue:** [concrete description]
- **Current:**
  ```
  [code snippet — max 5 lines]
  ```
- **Suggested:**
  ```
  [fix or recommendation — max 5 lines]
  ```

[Findings ordered: Critical → Warning → Suggestion, each sorted by file path]

### No Issues Found
[If applicable: "The changes follow project guidelines. No bugs, security issues, or guideline violations detected."]
```

For PR mode, include full-SHA code links:
- **GitHub:** `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/[full-sha]/path#L[start]-L[end]`
- **GitLab:** Extract the instance URL from `git remote get-url origin` (e.g., `https://gitlab.company.com`), then use: `https://[gitlab-host]/owner/repo/-/blob/[full-sha]/path#L[start]-L[end]`

## Step 7: Apply and Iterate (deep mode) / Offer Actions (normal mode)

### Normal mode

If the verdict is **CHANGES LOOK GOOD** (no findings), skip this step — do not present any action prompt. Go directly to the recommendation in the "Important" section below.

If the verdict is **ISSUES FOUND**, use `AskUserQuestion` to present actions. The options depend on the review mode determined in Step 1:

#### Local changes / branch diff mode

Use `AskUserQuestion` — header "Action", question "How would you like to proceed with the review findings?":
- **Fix issues** — "Apply suggested fixes directly, then run tests to verify"
- **Skip** — "Keep the report as reference only"

#### PR/MR review mode

Use `AskUserQuestion` — header "Action", question "How would you like to proceed with the review findings?":
- **Fix issues** — "Apply suggested fixes directly, then run tests to verify"
- **Post comment** — "Post the review summary as a PR/MR comment"
- **Skip** — "Keep the report as reference only"

Write the review summary to a secure temp file: `TMPFILE=$(mktemp "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/review-summary-XXXXXX.md")`. Always clean up after the posting attempt (whether it succeeds or fails): `rm -f "$TMPFILE"`.

For GitHub PRs: `gh pr comment <N> --body-file "$TMPFILE"`
For GitLab MRs: `glab api -X POST "projects/:id/merge_requests/<N>/notes" -F body=@"$TMPFILE"` — this avoids shell metacharacter issues that `glab mr note --message "$(cat ...)"` would have with code snippets in the summary

### Deep mode

On the first iteration, initialize `iteration-count` to 1, `total-fixed` to 0, `total-reverted` to 0, and `accumulated-findings` to an empty list.

If zero findings this iteration → convergence reached. Print "Iteration [N] of up to 5 — converged with zero findings." Then skip to the deep mode consolidated report below.

Otherwise, apply all findings from this iteration:

1. Before applying fixes, snapshot the current state: `git stash push -m "pre-iteration-N"`
2. For each finding, apply the suggested fix
3. After applying all fixes for this iteration, run the project's test command (from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
4. Follow the verification protocol from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/verification-protocol.md`:
   - If tests pass → `git stash drop` the snapshot, add this iteration's fixed count to `total-fixed`
   - If tests fail → restore pre-iteration state (`git stash pop`), then re-apply one at a time (in the same order they were originally applied) with a test run after each. Keep changes that pass, skip those that fail. If a fix fails to apply cleanly after an earlier fix was skipped, treat it as failed. After bisect completes, run the full test suite once more on the combined retained changes — if this combined run fails, revert all retained fixes from this iteration by restoring from `git stash pop`. Add passing count to `total-fixed`, failing count to `total-reverted`. Mark reverted findings in `accumulated-findings` as "(reverted — test failure)"

Print iteration progress: "Iteration [N] of up to 5 — [total-fixed] issues fixed so far, [total-reverted] reverted."

Check termination conditions:

1. **All fixes in this iteration were reverted due to test failures** → stop. Report: "Deep mode stopped — all fixes in iteration [N] caused test failures."
2. **No fixes were applied this iteration** (all findings lacked actionable edits) → stop. Report: "Deep mode stopped — no actionable fixes in iteration [N]. Remaining findings require manual review."
3. **`iteration-count` equals 5** → cap reached. Report: "Deep mode reached the iteration cap (5). Remaining findings may exist — re-run `/optimus:code-review deep` in a fresh conversation to continue."
4. **Otherwise** → increment `iteration-count` and **return to Step 4** for the next analysis pass. Re-gather the diff using only the local diff commands from Step 1 (`git diff --cached`, `git diff`, `git status --short`) — do not re-run scope detection or mode selection. On subsequent iterations, instruct agents to focus only on files that had findings in the previous iteration, not the entire working tree diff.

### Deep mode consolidated report

After the loop ends (convergence, cap, or failure stop), present the full consolidated report using the same output format from Step 6, but with ALL `accumulated-findings` across all iterations. Add these fields to the Summary block:

```
- Iterations: [N]
- Total fixed: [N]
- Total reverted: [N]
```

All fixes are already applied as local changes (never committed or pushed). The user can review the full diff before committing.

## Important

- Never modify files, commit, push, or post comments without explicit user approval (deep mode has explicit approval via the confirmation in Step 3)
- In normal mode, this skill is read-only by default — it only analyzes and reports
- In deep mode, it applies fixes automatically at each iteration — all changes remain as local modifications
- When changes are too broad for effective review, recommend narrowing scope

After the review is complete, recommend the next step based on the outcome:
- If deep mode completed → `/optimus:commit` to commit the accumulated fixes, then `/optimus:unit-test` to strengthen test coverage
- If issues were found and fixed (normal mode) → `/optimus:commit` to commit the fixes
- If no issues or user skipped fixes → `/optimus:pr` to create a pull request (skip this if already reviewing a PR/MR)

Tell the user: **Tip:** for best results, start a fresh conversation for the next skill — each skill gathers its own context from scratch.
