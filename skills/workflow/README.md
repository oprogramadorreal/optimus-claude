# optimus:workflow

A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that implements an approved spec by having Claude **design and run its own [dynamic workflow](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows)** — an orchestration of real parallel subagents that build the spec in the background.

You hand the skill a spec, a goal, and the constraints; Claude decides the phases, how many agents to run, and how they divide and cross-check the work. Intermediate results stay inside the workflow, so your main conversation stays clean and only the final, verified result returns. It is the self-orchestrated, parallel counterpart to `/optimus:tdd`'s supervised Red-Green-Refactor — pick it for large or parallelizable specs where one linear pass is slow.

Two facts to expect: Claude Code shows the planned phases for you to **approve before the run starts**, and a workflow uses **meaningfully more tokens** than a normal conversation (it spawns many agents).

## Workflow vs. TDD — which to use

Both implement an approved spec and hand off to `/optimus:pr`. They differ in *how* they build:

| | `/optimus:workflow` | `/optimus:tdd` |
|---|---|---|
| Shape | Parallel fan-out — Claude designs its own dynamic workflow | Sequential Red-Green-Refactor, one behavior per cycle |
| Who designs the build | Claude (phases, agent counts, cross-checking) | The skill (fixed cycle); you approve the behavior list |
| Test-first | Quality bar — tests accompany/precede code, suite left green | Enforced ceremony — failing test first (the Iron Law), then minimal pass, then refactor |
| Failing-test-first guarantee | No | Yes (per behavior) |
| User input | Launch-time phase approval only; none mid-run | Interactive checkpoints throughout |
| Best for | Large or parallelizable specs; many independent components; speed via fan-out | Tight test-first guarantee; bug fixes (reproduce-first); incremental, reviewable cycles |
| Commits | One (or few) after the fan-out | One per cycle |
| Token cost | Meaningfully higher (many parallel agents) | Normal session |
| Both | Require `/optimus:init`; auto-detect a spec in `docs/specs/`/`docs/jira/`; create a feature branch; push; hand off to `/optimus:pr` in the same conversation |

Rule of thumb: if the spec's value hinges on a failing-test-first proof — most bug fixes, anything where an after-the-fact test would just confirm the bug — use `/optimus:tdd`. Reach for `/optimus:workflow` when the spec is large or parallelizable and a verified-green suite produced by fan-out is the right trade of rigor for speed.

## Prerequisites

1. **`/optimus:init`** — required. Installs `CLAUDE.md`, `coding-guidelines.md`, the test framework/runner, and `testing.md` — these become the workflow's quality bar.
2. **Dynamic workflows enabled** — a recent Claude Code with the dynamic-workflows feature available (on some plans it must be turned on in `/config`).
3. **`/optimus:permissions`** — recommended. Branch-aware git protection so the workflow builds on a feature branch while protecting main/master. (Workflow agents auto-approve file edits, so bounding the branch and the edit scope matters.)
4. **`gh` or `glab` CLI** — optional. Needed when you run `/optimus:pr` afterward.

**Setup workflow**: `/optimus:init` → (`/optimus:brainstorm` to write a spec) → `/optimus:workflow`

## Usage

In Claude Code:

- `/optimus:workflow` — auto-detects the most recent spec in `docs/specs/` (or `docs/jira/`) and asks to confirm
- `/optimus:workflow docs/specs/2026-06-04-import-pipeline.md` — point it at a specific spec
- `/optimus:workflow "Build the CSV import pipeline with validation and dedupe"` — describe the goal inline

It is strongest right after `/optimus:brainstorm` writes a spec with a clear Components list and Out-of-Scope section — those become the workflow's scope bounds.

## How It Works

1. Verifies project context (`CLAUDE.md`, `coding-guidelines.md`, `testing.md`) and a **green** test baseline.
2. Acquires the spec via the shared context-detection cascade (explicit path → `docs/specs/` auto-discovery → `docs/jira/` → inline → ask), distilling a long spec to a single-sentence goal.
3. Creates a feature branch from the current branch (the workflow builds here; your original branch stays clean).
4. Hands Claude a natural-language brief and **runs the workflow** — Claude designs the orchestration (phases, agent counts, cross-checking) and builds in the background. You approve the planned phases first.
5. **Independently re-verifies** the result: runs the full suite fresh and confirms it is green (plus lint/type-check if configured). Never trusts the workflow's self-report.
6. Emits an `## Implementation Summary` block (components, tests, verification, coverage).
7. Commits, pushes, and recommends `/optimus:pr` in the same conversation.

## What You Control vs. What Claude Controls

- **You control:** the spec and goal, the in-scope/out-of-scope bounds, and the edit-forbidden paths. These are guardrails the workflow must respect.
- **Claude controls:** the orchestration shape — how many agents, what phases, where to fan out vs. pipeline, and where to cross-check. The skill deliberately does **not** prescribe phases or agent counts; Anthropic's guidance is that Claude chooses the shape that fits the task.

## Example Output

```

## Caveats

- **No mid-run input.** A workflow runs to completion; for sign-off between stages you would run separate workflows. The skill's checkpoints are *before* (phase approval) and *after* (green-suite verification).
- **Edits are auto-approved.** Workflow subagents edit with `acceptEdits` regardless of your session mode. The feature branch and the brief's edit-mode boundary are what keep changes in scope — `/optimus:permissions` is recommended.
- **Higher token use.** Run it on a small slice first to gauge spend on a large spec; you can stop a run from `/workflows` without losing completed work.
- **The green suite is the completion gate.** The skill re-runs the suite itself and will not commit a red or partial result.
- **`/optimus:workflow` (the skill) vs. "run a workflow" (the feature).** Invoking this skill is an explicit `/optimus:` command. Asking Claude to "run a workflow" in chat triggers the raw dynamic-workflow feature for an ad-hoc task — a different thing. For implementing a tracked spec, prefer this skill.

## Relationship to Other Skills

| | `/optimus:workflow` | `/optimus:brainstorm` |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Implement a spec via a parallel build | Explore design approaches and write the spec |
| Context flow | Consumes the spec in `docs/specs/` | Writes the spec `/optimus:workflow` consumes |

| | `/optimus:workflow` | `/optimus:pr` |
|---|---|---|
| Role | Builds, verifies green, emits `## Implementation Summary` | Reads that summary to populate `## Intent` and the per-component `## Test plan` |
| Handoff | Recommends `/optimus:pr` in the same conversation | Full Conventional PR flow (default-branch detection, CLI install, preview/confirm) |

| | `/optimus:workflow` | `/optimus:tdd` |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | Self-orchestrated parallel subagents | Supervised, sequential cycles |
| Test-first | Quality bar (suite left green) | Per-behavior Iron Law (failing test first) |
| When to pick | Large or parallelizable spec; speed via fan-out | Want supervision and a failing-test-first guarantee |

**Full workflow**: `/optimus:init` → `/optimus:brainstorm` (write the spec) → `/optimus:workflow` (parallel build — creates branch, commits, pushes) → `/optimus:pr` in the same conversation (create the PR/MR, Intent/Test-plan from the summary) → `/optimus:code-review` in a fresh conversation. `/optimus:tdd` is the supervised, test-first alternative to `/optimus:workflow` at the build step.
