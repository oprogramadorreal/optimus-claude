# Pull Request / Merge Request

Create or update a PR (GitHub) or MR (GitLab) for the current branch using the Conventional PR format. Detects the hosting platform, checks for an existing PR/MR, and either creates a new one or offers to update the existing one. New PRs target the repository's default branch; updates to existing PRs use the PR's current target branch. PRs/MRs are created as ready to merge (not draft).

## Step 1: Pre-flight

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/init/references/multi-repo-detection.md` for workspace detection. If a multi-repo workspace is detected, run the multi-repo selection procedure below. Otherwise, skip to **Verify git state**.

### Multi-repo selection

1. For each child repo, check:
   - Current branch: `git -C <repo-path> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - Default branch: use the algorithm from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/default-branch-detection.md` (run inside the repo)
   - Whether it has commits ahead of default: `git -C <repo-path> log --oneline origin/<default-branch>..HEAD 2>/dev/null | head -1`
2. If default branch detection fails for a repo, warn the user (e.g., "Could not detect default branch for `<repo>` — skipping") and exclude it from the candidates list
3. Filter to repos that are on a non-default branch AND have commits ahead of the default branch
4. If **no repos** have changes → inform the user: "No repositories in this workspace have branches with changes ready for a PR." Stop.
5. If **one repo** has changes → inform the user which repo was detected and proceed to run Steps 2–8 inside that repo's directory
6. If **multiple repos** have changes → present the list and use `AskUserQuestion` — header "Multi-Repo PRs", question "Multiple repositories have changes ready for PRs:". Options:
   - **All** — "Create PRs for all repos with changes (one at a time)"
   - Each individual repo name — "Create PR for `<repo>` only"
7. If the user selects a specific repo, proceed to run Steps 2–8 inside that repo's directory
8. If the user selects **All**, process each repo with changes through Steps 2–8 sequentially. For each repo: run all commands inside that repo's directory, complete Steps 2–7 fully (including the per-repo report in Step 7), then **continue to the next repo**. After the last repo, show the combined summary from Step 8

### Verify git state

1. Confirm the current directory is inside a git repository: `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`. If not → inform the user and stop.
2. Get the current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
3. Check that the current branch is not the default branch. Detect the default branch using the algorithm in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/default-branch-detection.md`. If no default branch can be determined → inform the user: "Could not detect the default branch. Ensure `origin` is configured and has been fetched." Stop. If on the default branch → inform the user: "You're on the default branch (`<branch>`). Switch to a feature branch first." Stop.

## Step 2: Platform Detection

When processing multiple repos, show a heading (e.g., `## repo-name`) before starting this step for each repo.

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/platform-detection.md` and use the **Platform Detection Algorithm** section. If platform is unknown → inform the user that the hosting platform could not be determined and stop.

## Step 3: CLI Availability

Read `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/platform-detection.md` and use the **CLI Verification** section to check availability and authentication. If the CLI is not installed, use the **CLI Installation** section — offer to install via `AskUserQuestion` (header "Install CLI", question "The [GitHub CLI (`gh`) / GitLab CLI (`glab`)] is required but not installed. Install it now?"):
- **Install** — "Install automatically (requires [package manager])"
- **Cancel** — "I'll install it manually"

If the user chooses **Cancel** → provide manual installation instructions and stop.
If installation fails → provide manual installation instructions and stop.
If installed but auth fails → inform the user: "CLI installed. Run `[gh/glab] auth login` to authenticate, then re-run `/optimus:pr`." Stop.

## Step 4: Branch and Existing PR/MR Check

### Push branch if needed

Check if the branch has been pushed: `git ls-remote --heads origin <branch> 2>/dev/null`

If the branch is not on the remote:
1. Check for commits: `git log --oneline HEAD --not --remotes 2>/dev/null | head -1`. If no commits → inform the user: "No commits on this branch yet. Commit your changes first." Stop.
2. Push: `git push -u origin <branch>`

If the branch is on the remote but has unpushed commits (`git log origin/<branch>..HEAD --oneline`), push them: `git push origin <branch>`

### Check for existing PR/MR

- **GitHub:** `gh pr view --json number,state,title,body,url,baseRefName 2>/dev/null`
  - If a PR exists and is **open** → save the `baseRefName` as the PR's **target branch**, then go to Step 6 (Update Flow)
  - If a PR exists but is **closed/merged** → treat as no PR (create a new one)
  - If no PR exists → go to Step 5 (Create Flow)

- **GitLab:** `glab mr view --output json 2>/dev/null`
  - If an MR exists and is **opened** → save the `target_branch` from the JSON as the MR's **target branch**, then go to Step 6 (Update Flow)
  - If an MR exists but is **closed/merged** → treat as no MR
  - If no MR exists → go to Step 5 (Create Flow)

## Step 5: Create Flow

### Detect default branch

- **GitHub:** `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'`
- **GitLab:** use the default branch detected in Step 1, or `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'`

### Gather change data

Collect information about the changes on the branch:

```bash
# Commit list
git log --oneline origin/<default-branch>..HEAD

# Changed files summary
git diff --stat origin/<default-branch>..HEAD

# Full diff for analysis
git diff origin/<default-branch>..HEAD
```

If there are no commits ahead of the default branch → inform the user: "This branch has no changes compared to `<default-branch>`." Stop.

### Generate PR content

Read the Conventional PR template: `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/pr-template.md`

Generate a title and body following the template. When filling in the sections:
- Synthesize the **Summary** from commit messages, changed files, and the diff
- Use `git diff --stat` output as a starting point for **Changes**, then describe what each file change accomplishes
- For the **Test plan**, look for: test files in the diff → "Run `<test command>` to verify"; CI configuration → "CI pipeline will run automatically"; manual verification → describe what to check

### Preview and confirm

Present the generated title and body to the user (in a multi-repo workspace, include the repo name in the header):

```
## PR Preview [— repo-name]

**Title:** <title>

---

<body>
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` — header "PR preview", question "Review the PR/MR title and description above. Proceed or adjust?":
- **Create PR** — "Looks good — create the PR/MR"
- **Adjust** — "I want to modify the title or description"

If the user chooses **Adjust**, ask what to change, apply modifications, and preview again.

### Create PR/MR

Write the body via the canonical pattern in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/body-file-tempfile.md` (stem `pr-body`). The heredoc keeps body content out of shell expansion; chain the create command into the same bash invocation so the cleanup trap stays in scope:

- **GitHub:**

  ```bash
  TMPFILE=$(mktemp ./.pr-body-XXXXXX.md) && trap 'rm -f "$TMPFILE"' EXIT INT TERM && cat > "$TMPFILE" <<'OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF' && gh pr create --title "<title>" --body-file "$TMPFILE" --base <default-branch>
  <body>
  OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF
  ```

- **GitLab:**

  ```bash
  TMPFILE=$(mktemp ./.pr-body-XXXXXX.md) && trap 'rm -f "$TMPFILE"' EXIT INT TERM && cat > "$TMPFILE" <<'OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF' && glab mr create --title "<title>" --description "$(cat "$TMPFILE")" --target-branch <default-branch>
  <body>
  OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF
  ```

Proceed to Step 7.

## Step 6: Update Flow

### Show current PR/MR

Display the current title and body to the user:

```
## Existing PR/MR

**#<number>:** <title>
**URL:** <url>

---

<current body>
```

### Ask what to update

Use `AskUserQuestion` — header "Update PR", question "A PR/MR already exists for this branch. What would you like to do?":
- **Regenerate title and description** — "Regenerate both using the Conventional PR format based on current branch changes"
- **Regenerate description only** — "Keep the current title, regenerate the description"
- **Cancel** — "Keep the current PR/MR as-is"

If the user chooses **Cancel** → report the existing PR/MR URL and stop.

### Regenerate content

#### Phase 1 — Generate fresh content

Gather change data using the existing PR/MR's **target branch** (saved in Step 4) as the base for diffs — use it in place of `<default-branch>` in the `git log`, `git diff --stat`, and `git diff` commands from Step 5. Generate new content following the Conventional PR template. This is the authoritative content. Do not present yet.

#### Phase 2 — Scan existing content for non-diff information

Review the existing PR/MR title and body (saved from Step 4) for information that **cannot be derived from code changes**. Examples: issue/ticket references (`#45`, `JIRA-123`), deployment instructions, external links, reviewer-directed notes, or follow-up tasks.

**Never preserve facts that are derivable from the current diff** — version numbers, file counts, function/class/symbol names, path names, line counts, or changed-file lists. These must come from Phase 1's fresh content. If the existing body contains such a fact (for example, "plugin version incremented from 1.56.1 to 1.59.0"), discard the old value and use the one re-derived from the current diff, even if the old value was correct when the PR was first opened. Rebases and force-pushes can change any of these, so the description must always match what reviewers see in "Files changed".

Discard anything that is outdated, factually wrong based on current diffs, or already covered by the freshly generated content. If useful non-diff information is found:

1. **Standard sections**: Integrate at a natural position within the matching section of the new content (e.g., issue references in Summary, manual verification steps in Test plan).
2. **Non-standard sections**: If the existing body has sections outside the four standard ones (e.g., `## Deployment notes`, `## Related issues`) that contain non-diff information still relevant, preserve them after `## Test plan`.
3. **Title**: Only when regenerating the title — if the existing title contains an issue reference or similar non-diff context, incorporate it into the new title while keeping Conventional Commit format.

#### Phase 3 — Preview

Present the final content for preview. If any non-diff information was carried over from the existing PR/MR, add a brief note above the preview: "Note: some manually-added content from the existing PR/MR was carried over (issue references, deployment notes, etc.)."

Use `AskUserQuestion` — header "Update preview", question "Review the updated PR/MR. Proceed or adjust?":
- **Update** — "Apply changes to the PR/MR"
- **Adjust** — "I want to modify before updating"

### Apply update

Apply the canonical pattern from `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/pr/references/body-file-tempfile.md` (stem `pr-body`). Use the same chained heredoc form as Step 5 so `$TMPFILE` and the cleanup trap stay in scope across the create/edit step:

- **GitHub:**

  ```bash
  TMPFILE=$(mktemp ./.pr-body-XXXXXX.md) && trap 'rm -f "$TMPFILE"' EXIT INT TERM && cat > "$TMPFILE" <<'OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF' && gh pr edit <number> --title "<title>" --body-file "$TMPFILE"
  <body>
  OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF
  ```

  Drop `--title "<title>"` if keeping the existing title.

- **GitLab:**

  ```bash
  TMPFILE=$(mktemp ./.pr-body-XXXXXX.md) && trap 'rm -f "$TMPFILE"' EXIT INT TERM && cat > "$TMPFILE" <<'OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF' && glab mr update <number> --title "<title>" --description "$(cat "$TMPFILE")"
  <body>
  OPTIMUS_BODY_EOF
  ```

Proceed to Step 7.

## Step 7: Per-Repo Report

```
## PR/MR [Created / Updated] [— repo-name]

- URL: [PR/MR URL]
- Title: [title]
- Target: [target-branch]
- Status: Ready to merge
```

If processing multiple repos, **continue to the next repo** — go back to Step 2 for the next repo in the list. Do NOT show next-step recommendations or the fresh-conversation tip until all repos are done. After the last repo (or if processing a single repo), proceed to Step 8.

## Step 8: Final Summary

In a multi-repo workspace where multiple repos were processed, show a combined summary across all repos:

```
## All PRs/MRs Created

| Repo | PR/MR | URL |
|------|-------|-----|
| `repo-name` | title | URL |
```

Recommend running `/optimus:code-review` for quality review before merging.

Tell the user: **Tip:** for best results, start a fresh conversation for the next skill — each skill gathers its own context from scratch.
